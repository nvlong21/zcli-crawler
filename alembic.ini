[post_write_hooks]
# Optional hooks to run after migration generation (e.g., formatting)
# Requires the executables to be available in the environment where Alembic runs.
# Example using Ruff:
# hooks = ruff
# ruff.type = exec
# ruff.executable = poetry run ruff # Or path to ruff executable
# ruff.args = format --silent %(branch_scripts)s # Format generated script(s)

# --- Standard Python Logging Configuration ---
# Alembic uses this if fileConfig() is not called in env.py's run_migrations_online
# Usually, env.py takes precedence.
